## API Changes

### Before (With Issues)
```csharp
GetCountriesAsync(page: 1)              // ? Page not valid
GetLeaguesAsync(page: 1)                // ? Page not valid
GetTeamsAsync(page: 1)                  // ? Page not valid
GetTeamPlayersAsync(team.Id, page: 1)   // ? Endpoint doesn't exist
```

### After (Fixed)
```csharp
GetCountriesAsync()                     // ? Works!
GetLeaguesAsync()                       // ? Works!
GetTeamsAsync()                         // ? Works!
GetTeamsByLeagueAsync(leagueId, season) // ? Works!
GetMatchesByLeagueAndSeasonAsync(...)   // ? Works!
// Players endpoint removed - not available
```
