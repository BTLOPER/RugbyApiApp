# ?? Quick Fix Summary

## The Error
```
JSON could not be converted to System.Nullable`1[System.Int32]. 
Path: $.get
```

## The Cause
The `Get` property in `ApiResponse<T>` was defined as `int?` but the API returns it as a `string` containing the endpoint path (e.g., "/seasons").

## The Fix
**File**: `DTOs/ApiResponse.cs`

```csharp
// Before (Wrong)
public int? Get { get; set; }

// After (Correct)
public string? Get { get; set; }
```

## Why
The API response includes metadata:
```json
{
  "get": "/seasons",           // ? String! Not integer
  "paging": { "current": 1 },
  "response": [ /* data */ ]
}
```

## Result
? All API calls now work correctly  
? Seasons fetch successfully  
? All other endpoints (leagues, teams, matches, players) work too  

## Status
**FIXED** ? Build successful, ready to use
